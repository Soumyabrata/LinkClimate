# Link Climate: An Interoperable Knowledge Graph Platform for Climate Data
With the spirit of reproducible research, this repository includes a complete collection of codes required to generate the results and the diagrams presented in the paper:

> J. Wu, F. Orlandi, D. O'Sullivan, S. Dev, Link Climate: An Interoperable Knowledge Graph Platform for Climate Data, *Under Review*.

## Instruction to the Code Usage
This repository cantains the implementation of workflow components described in the paper, namely, defining the **Climate Analysis** ontology, fetching NOAA climate data, mapping NOAA climate data to RDF data, saving RDF data to our triplestore and the task scheduler implementation doing the aboved jobs periodically.
